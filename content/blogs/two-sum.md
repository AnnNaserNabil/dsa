Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

### Example 1:

```text
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
```

### Solution:

```python
def twoSum(nums, target):
    prevMap = {} # val : index

    for i, n in enumerate(nums):
        diff = target - n
        if diff in prevMap:
            return [prevMap[diff], i]
        prevMap[n] = i
    return
```
